# macOS Intune App Repository
Welcome to the home of macOS Intune Apps! This repository contains auto packaging tools that help you create Intune ready apps for popular applications such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. More apps to come in the future! To get started please do the following.

1. Pull down the repository to your computer.
2. Open Terminal and make the IntunePackageManager.sh script executable.
3. Run IntunePackageManager.sh with sudo from the terminal. This will install the latest version of the Microsoft Intune App Wrapping Tool for macOS into your Applications folder.
4. Change Directory into the Application folder you want to package. Ex: "Google Chrome Enterprise".
5. Launch the packager script in that folder with sudo and the script will create the desired .intunemac file for the application!
